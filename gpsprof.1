.SH "NAME"
gpsprof \- profile a GPS and gpsd, plotting latency information
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 8
\fBgpsprof\fR [\-f\ \fIplot_type\fR] [\-m\ \fIthreshold\fR] [\-n\ \fIpacketcount\fR] [\-s\ \fIspeed\fR] [\-t\ \fItitle\fR] [\-h]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
gpsprof
measures the various latencies between a GPS and its client\&. It emits to standard output a GNUPLOT program that draws an illustrative graph\&. It can also be told to emit the raw profile data\&. The information it provides can be useful for establishing an upper bound on latency, and thus on position accuracy of a GPS in motion\&.
.PP
gpsprof
uses instrumentation built into
gpsd\&.
.PP
To display the graph, use
\fBgnuplot\fR(1)\&. Thus, for example, to display the default spatial scatter plot, do this:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
gpsprof | gnuplot \-persist
.fi
.RE
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The \-f option sets the plot type\&. The X axis is samples (sentences with timestamps)\&. The Y axis is normally latency in seconds\&. Currently the following plot types are defined:
.PP
space
.RS 4
Generate a scattergram of fixes and plot a probable\-error circle\&. This data is only meaningful if the GPS is held stationary while
gpsprof
is running\&. This is the default\&.
.sp
.RE
.PP
uninstrumented
.RS 4
Plot total latency without instrumentation\&. Useful mainly as a check that the instrumentation is not producing significant distortion\&. It only plots times for sentences that contain fixes; staircase\-like artifacts in the plot are created when elapsed time from sentences without fixes is lumped in\&.
.RE
.PP
raw
.RS 4
Plot raw data\&.
.RE
.PP
split
.RS 4
Each sentence has its RS232 latency time colored differently\&.
.RE
.PP
cycle
.RS 4
Report on the set of sentences or packets emitted by the GPS, their send intervals, and the basic cycle time\&. (This report is plain text rather than a gnuplot script\&.)
.RE
.PP
The instrumented time plot conveys the following information:
.PP
RS232 time
.RS 4
Minimum time required to send the sentence from the GPS to
gpsd\&. This is computed, not measured, and may be an underestimate\&.
.RE
.PP
Other line latency
.RS 4
The transmission latency between the GPS and
gpsd
not accounted for by RS232 time\&. Total line latency (the sum of this bar and RS232 time) is measured; it begins with the GPS sentence\'s timestamp and ends with a timestamp that
gpsd
generates at sentence\-reading time, before it is decoded\&.
.RE
.PP
Decode time
.RS 4
Elapsed time between sentence reception and the moment that
gpsd
ships the resulting update to the profiling client\&.
.RE
.PP
TCP/IP latency
.RS 4
Elapsed time between the moment that
gpsd
ships the update to the profiling client and the moment it is decoded and timestamped\&.
.RE
.PP
Because of RS232 buffering effects, the profiler sometimes generates reports of ridiculously high latencies right at the beginning of a session\&. The \-m option lets you set a latency threshold, in multiples of the cycle time, above which reports are discarded\&.
.PP
The \-n option sets the number of packets to sample\&. The default is 100\&.
.PP
The \-s option sets the baud rate\&. Note, this will only work if the chipset accepts a speed\-change command (SiRFstarII and SiRFstarIII support this feature)\&.
.PP
The \-t option sets a text string to be included in the plot title\&.
.PP
The \-h option makes
gpsprof
print a usage message and exit\&.
.SH "BUGS AND LIMITAIONS"
.PP
Probably overestimates TCP/IP latency somewhat, as that includes the Python interpreter\'s decode time\&. A C client would be faster\&.
