.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is a batch\-mode decoder for NMEA and various binary packet formats associated with GPS, AIS, and differential\-correction services\&. It produces a JSON dump on standard output from binary on standard input\&. The JSON is the same format documented in
\fBgpsd\fR(8); this tool uses the same decoding logic as gpsd, but with a simpler interface intended for batch processing of data files\&.
.PP
All sensor\-input formats known to the GPSD project can be decoded by this tool\&. These include: NMEA, AIVDM (the NMEA\-derived sentence format used by AIS, the marine Automatic Identification System), RTCM2, and all supported GPS binary formats (notably including SiRF)\&. See
\fBgpsd\fR(8)
for applicable standards and known limitations of the decoding logic\&.
.PP
You can use this tool with
\fBnc\fR(1)
to examine AIS feeds from AIS pooling services, RTCM feeds from RTCM receivers or NTRIP broadcasters\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Output a usage mssage, then exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-json\fR
.RS 4
Sets the AIS dump format to separate fields with an ASCII pipe symbol\&. Fields are dumped in the order they occur in the AIS packet\&. Numerics are not scaled (\fB\-u\fR
is forced)\&. Strings are unpacked from six\-bit to full ASCII
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-decode\fR
.RS 4
Decode packets presented on standard input to standard output\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D LVL\fR, \fB\-\-debug LVL\fR
.RS 4
Set the debug verbosity level to LVL\&. It is mainly of interest to for troubleshooting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-encode\fR
.RS 4
Encode JSON on standard input to JSON on standard output\&. This option is only useful for regression\-testing of the JSON dumping and parsing code\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-json\fR
.RS 4
Sets the output dump format to JSON (the default behavior)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-minlength\fR
.RS 4
Dump minimum lengths for each packet type in the input (ignoring comment packets)\&. This is probably of interest only to GSD developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nmea\fR
.RS 4
Dump the generated pseudo\-NME0183\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-split24\fR
.RS 4
Report AIS Type 24 sentence halves separately rather than attempting to aggregate them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t TYPES\fR, \fB\-\-types TYPES\fR
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of numeric types\&. Packets with a numeric AIS, RTCM2, or RTCM3 type are passed through and output only if they match a type in the list\&. Packets of other kinds (in particular GPS packets) are passed through unconditionally\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unsscaled\fR
.RS 4
Suppress scaling of AIS data to float quantities and text expansion of numeric codes\&. A dump with this option is lossless\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Dump textual packets to output as they are received on input, immediately preceding corresponding output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print version number, then exit\&.
.RE
.SH "AIS DSV FORMAT"
.PP
With the
\fB\-c, \-\-ais\fR
option, dump lines are values of AIS payload fields, pipe\-separated, in the order that they occur in the payload\&. Spans of fields expressing a date are emitted as an ISO8601 timestamp (look for colons and the trailing Z indicating Zulu/UTC time), and the 19\-bit group of TDMA status fields found at the end of message types 1\-4 are are dumped as a single unsigned integer (in hex preceded by "0x")\&. Unused regional\-authority fields are also dumped (in hex preceded by "0x")\&. Variable\-length binary fields are dumped as an integer bit length, followed by a colon, followed by a hex dump\&.
